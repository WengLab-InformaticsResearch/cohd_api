    The Columbia Open Health Data (COHD) API provides access to counts and frequencies (i.e., EHR prevalence) of conditions, procedures, drug exposures, and patient demographics, and the co-occurrence frequencies between them. Count and frequency data were derived from the [Columbia University Medical Center's](http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/) [OHDSI](https://www.ohdsi.org/) database including inpatient and outpatient data. Counts are the number of patients associated with the concept, e.g., diagnosed with a condition, exposed to a drug, or who had a procedure. Frequencies are the number of unique patients associated with the concept divided by the total number of patients in the dataset, i.e., prevalence in the electronic health records. To protect patient privacy, all concepts and pairs of concepts where the count <= 10 were excluded, and counts were randomized by the Poisson distribution.         
    
    Four datasets are available: 
    1) 5-year non-hierarchical dataset: Includes clinical data from 2013-2017  
    2) lifetime non-hierarchical dataset: Includes clinical data from all dates  
    3) 5-year hierarchical dataset: Counts for each concept include patients from descendant concepts. Includes clinical data from 2013-2017.
    4) BETA! Temporal co-occurrence data
    
    In the 5-year hierarchical data set, the counts for each concept include the patients from all descendant concepts. For example, the count for ibuprofen (ID 1177480) includes patients with Ibuprofen 600 MG Oral Tablet (ID 19019073 patients), Ibuprofen 400 MG Oral Tablet (ID 19019072), Ibuprofen 20 MG/ML Oral Suspension (ID 19019050), etc. 

    While the lifetime dataset captures a larger patient population and range of concepts, the 5-year dataset has better underlying data consistency. 
    
    Clinical concepts (e.g., conditions, procedures, drugs) are coded by their standard concept ID in the [OMOP Common Data Model](https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel/wiki). API methods are provided to map to/from other vocabularies supported in OMOP and other ontologies using the EMBL-EBI Ontology Xref Service (OxO). 


    The following resources are available through this API: 


    1. Metadata: Metadata on the COHD database, including dataset descriptions, number of concepts, etc. 


    2. OMOP: Access to the common vocabulary for name and concept identifier mapping


    3. Clinical Frequencies: Access to the counts and frequencies of conditions, procedures, and drug exposures, and the associations between them. Frequency was determined as the number of patients with the code(s) / total number of patients. 


    4. Concept Associations: Inferred associations between concepts using chi-square analysis, ratio between observed to expected frequency, and relative frequency. 
    
    
    A [Python notebook](https://github.com/WengLab-InformaticsResearch/cohd_api/blob/master/notebooks/COHD_API_Example.ipynb) demonstrates simple examples of how to use the COHD API.


    COHD was developed at the [Columbia University Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/) as a collaboration between the [Weng Lab](http://people.dbmi.columbia.edu/~chw7007/), [Tatonetti Lab](http://tatonettilab.org/), and the [NCATS Biomedical Data Translator](https://ncats.nih.gov/translator) program (Red Team). This work was supported in part by grants: NCATS OT3TR002027, NLM R01LM009886-08A1, and NIGMS R01GM107145.

This method attempts to use OxO to map from the original ontology to an intermediate ontology that is included in OMOP (ICD9CM, ICD10CM, SNOMEDCT, and MeSH), then uses the OMOP mappings to the standard concepts. Multiple mappings may be returned. Results are sorted by total_distance (OxO distance + OMOP distance) in ascending order.

            COHD can either call the OxO API or use the local implementation of OxO. The full call to the OxO API will have the most updated mappings and term definitions, but is slower.

      summary: Cross-reference from an ontology to OMOP standard concepts using the Ontology Xref Service
      description: >-
        Attempts to map a concept from an external ontology to an OMOP standard concept ID using the EMBL-EBI Ontology Xref Service (OxO): https://www.ebi.ac.uk/spot/oxo/index. This method maps from the OMOP standard concept to an intermediate vocabulary included is OxO (ICD9CM, ICD10CM, SNOMEDCT, and MeSH), then uses the OxO API to map to other ontologies. Multiple mappings may be returned. Results are sorted by total_distance (OxO distance + OMOP distance) in ascending order.

            Mapping distance for OxO. Note: this is the distance used in the OxO API to map from an ICD9CM, ICD10CM, SNOMEDCT, or MeSH concept to the desired ontology. One additional step may be taken by the COHD API to map to the OMOP standard concept to ICD9CM, ICD10CM, SNOMEDCT, or
            MeSH. Default: 2.

            COHD can either call the OxO API or use the local implementation of OxO. The full call to the OxO API will have the most updated mappings and term definitions, but is slower. The local implementation of OxO is faster but may contain outdated mappings and term definitions. If the parameter is false, COHD will call the full OxO API. If the parameter is true, COHD will use the local implementation.  Default: false.

        The expected frequencies for the chi-square analysis are calculated based on the single concept frequencies and assuming independence between concepts. P-value is calculated with 1 DOF.

      summary: Relative frequency between pairs of concepts
      description: >
        Calculates the relative frequency (i.e., conditional probability) between pairs of concepts. Results are returned in descending order of relative frequency. Note that due to the randomization of the counts, the calculated relative frequencies can exceed the limit of 1.0.


        Relative Frequency = Count_1_and_2 / Count_2


        This method has overloaded behavior based on the specified parameters:


        1) concept_id_1 and concept_id_2: Result for the pair (concept_id_1, concept_id_2)

        2) concept_id_1: Results for all pairs of concepts that include concept_id_1

        3) concept_id_1 and domain: Results for all pairs of concepts including concept_id_1 and where concept_id_2 belongs to the specified domain

        a pair of concepts (source_concept and target_concept), a positive delta indicates that source_concept was 
        observed before target_concept. Likewise, a negaitve delta indicates that source_concept was observed after
        target_concept. Performing this query with the two concepts swapped will produce a mirrored distribution.   
          
        Bin widths grow exponentially, and different concept pairs will have different bin_widths. The binning schemes
        are as follows (delta bins with negative values mirror the positive delta bins):  
          bin_width=1: [0 day, 1 day, 2-3 days, 4-7 days, 8-15 days, ..., 2048-4095 days (5.6-11.2y), and 4096+ days
          (11.2+ years)].  
          bin_width=2: [0 day, 1-3 days, 4-15 days, 16-63 days, ..., 256-1023 days, 1024+ days (2.8+ years)]  
          bin_width=4: [0 day, 1-15 days, 16-255 days, 256+ days]  
          bin_width=8: [0 day, 1-255 days, 256+ days]  
          bin_width=16: [0 day, 1+ days]  
          The 0-day bin never gets incorporated into larger bins.
            
        Counts in each bin are independently perturbed with a Poisson distribution. Counts < 10 are suppressed,
        represented by the value 1. Counts of 0 are reported as 0.

            lists of target ontology prefixes, e.g., ['ICD9', 'UMLS', 'DOID']. An emtpy list indicates not to perform
            mapping for the specified type. Use the key '_DEFAULT' to indicate a default list of target ontologies for
            any unspecified types. If a domain is specified, it will override the '_DEFAULT' list. Target ontology
            prefixes should match the Biolink yaml but may include prefixes outside of Biolink.
